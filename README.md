> A libp2p transport implementation for utp.

## ⚠️ Unmaintained ⚠️

This library is not currently maintained and isn't kept up-to-date with the latest go-libp2p releases. If you'd like to revive it, please fork it, get it working again, and start a discussion on https://discuss.libp2p.io/.

However, if you're just looking for a UDP-based libp2p transport, try [QUIC](https://github.com/libp2p/go-libp2p-quic-transport/). It's better in just about every way (1RTT handshake, built-in stream multiplexing with no head of line blocking, etc.).
